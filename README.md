# raytracer
A simple raytracer renderer. I am following [this tutorial](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) by Peter Shirley.

## How do I compile and run this project?
Tools you need:
* [Codeblocks](http://www.codeblocks.org/)
* [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/)

Simply import the project into Codeblocks and build it.

Now, when running it, you want to navigate to `[PROJECT ROOT]/bin/Debug/` and *in the command line* run `./raytracer.out > image.ppm`. This will actually write the image to a file `image.ppm`.
